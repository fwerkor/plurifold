# Programming model

## Task

A Task is a logical computation. It declares:

- artifact/entrypoint identity;
- input Object IDs;
- resource requirements;
- cost hints;
- effect/retry semantics;
- optional affinity/anti-affinity hints;
- optional checkpoint capability.

The first implementation treats a Task as one-shot work. Dynamic graph construction is allowed: a completed task may cause more tasks to be submitted.

## Object

An Object has a stable logical ID and metadata independent of placement. Physical locations are replicas, not identities.

Object properties include:

- byte size;
- optional content digest;
- encoding/media type;
- producing task/attempt lineage;
- replica locations.

Objects are immutable after publication. Mutable application state is represented as a sequence of versions.

## Resource

A Resource is a leased capability advertisement, not a permanent machine record. It describes what can be scheduled there now:

- architecture and OS;
- CPU cores and memory;
- accelerators and device memory;
- executor/runtime capabilities;
- normalized performance hint;
- reliability/failure estimate;
- queue pressure;
- topology links.

## Effects and retries

The task effect model is intentionally small:

- `Pure`: no externally visible side effects; freely replayable.
- `Idempotent`: effects are safe to repeat using an application-provided idempotency key or equivalent protocol.
- `Exclusive`: effects are not replay-safe; the runtime must not automatically create a second execution after an uncertain failure.

This avoids claiming exactly-once execution in a distributed system when only at-least-once task dispatch is actually available.

## Actor (planned)

An Actor will be a stable logical identity with state represented by versioned objects and a serialized message order. Migration occurs at explicit state checkpoints. The design goal is logical mobility rather than arbitrary process-memory migration.

## Stream (planned)

Streams will add flow control, bounded buffering, and placement pressure. A stream edge is a stronger locality signal than an immutable object edge because repeated transfer cost can dominate.

## Collective (planned)

Collectives are explicit, topology-constrained operations. They are never automatically expanded from a low-latency island to a WAN-wide group merely because more resources become available.

## Portable execution ABI

Mosaic separates the **control/data model** from the **artifact execution ABI**. WASI 0.3 / the WebAssembly Component Model is a strong candidate for portable CPU-side tasks because it offers typed cross-language composition and native async primitives. Accelerator-heavy tasks will often remain backend-specific; the scheduler can select among multiple implementations of one logical task.
